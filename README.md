# Incremental migration of Monoliths into Microservices for large legacy systems in the corporate world

## Description
How can a proof-of-concept trading platform be migrated incrementally from a monolithic legacy system to a microservice architecture such that the disruption of active trading operations is minimized.

### Abstract
It is not uncommon for large corporations in the modern world to rely heavily on software solutions which were developed according to the standards of the last millennium. These systems might have been state-of-the-art at the time, but the rapid evolution of software technology has made them outdated. However, seeing as these systems often do extremely business critical operations, the easiest solution for companies is often to build upon the legacy systems when new features need to be introduced, rather than rebuild them using modern standards. In essence, we are dealing with business infrastructure that on the one hand is highly critical and on the other is hopelessly outdated. 
In this project we will explore and research methods to migrate large legacy systems built as monoliths into modern microservice architecture. Our aim is to do so incrementally as a way to avoid disrupting the operations they are performing. Our goal is to explore a general way of migrating that can be applied to most, if not all, legacy monoliths. For this project, we will be using the trading platform at Danske Bank as an example of this general migration.
